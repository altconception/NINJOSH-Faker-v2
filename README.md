# NINJOSH-Faker-v2

NOTICE: This code, particularly the Bot_code file is still under work, and the type effectiveness calc 
does not work in the bot as of now as I need to finish porting it to the Discord API correctly. 


This bot is designed to be a helper of sorts in Pokemon Discord servers, specifically in the competetive community and for tournaments. 


You'll need to install all of the libraries needed, and probably run it in some sort of anaconda enviroment although 
its not required if you have good file management.
It's also written in Python 3.6 due to Discord.py being discontinued unfortunately. If I do move to Discord.js it will likely be a whole new bot.
Obviously, you will also need to make your own bot application in the Discord Developer Portal, and I would recommend giving it administrative permissions.
Make sure to check the code to see if it does anything you don't want it to do however. I made it open source for a reason.


If you add yourself to the valid_users list, then you can type in the Discord chat (it can be any that your bot is in,
assuming you give it administrative permissions), type %help to get all the commands listed so far. A normal user can also type %help,
but they will get fewer commands.  




Things to do for the bot:

1. Convert the type calc to Discord API.

2. Potentially add damage calculator as well? Could prove difficult however.

3. Add bracket generator for tournaments.

4. Random Pokemon generator, or even a random team generator based on Pikalytics stats?


Hope you enjoy the bot, feel free to change any code for your own bot, but I would ask that you keep %credits the same :)
